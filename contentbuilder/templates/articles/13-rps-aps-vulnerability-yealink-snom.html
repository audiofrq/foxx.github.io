On Wednesday 23rd October 2013, I released a security disclosure highlighting vulnerabilities in several vendors/providers relating to APS/RPS (Automated/Redirection Provision System). These flaws puts hundreds of thousands of users at risk of toll fraud, and most vendors/providers chose to ignore the problem when I reported it to them a year ago (it was discovered in mid 2012).

This was disclosed live and exclusive into the FreeSWITCH community over Google Hangout. You can watch the original <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yN_-g-0PAk">video here</a>, and download the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hp5fj7e7o1mdnyt/Auto%20provisioning%20sucks.pptx">slides here</a>

There is more to come, watch this space.
