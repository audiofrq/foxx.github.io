Had a couple of people asking what sort of home office set up I have, so here you go (taken in early 2012).

Cat will sleep through pretty much anything!

It got messy!! [<img src="http://blog.simplicitymedialtd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DSCN1053.jpg" alt="" title="DSCN1053" width="2000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-188" />][6] From the left.. [<img src="http://blog.simplicitymedialtd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DSCN1055.jpg" alt="" title="DSCN1055" width="2000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-189" />][7] From the right.. I'm hoping to make a few improvements in here soon, given that I'm now spending nearly 14 hours a day in here!
