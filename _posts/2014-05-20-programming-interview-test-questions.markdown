Thankfully, a lot of companies now ask for a code test to be completed before going for an interview. This saves time on both sides, and is an absolute must.

Some of these tests are absolutely useless, such as [FizzBuzz](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/9751/ultra-beginner-python-fizzbuzz-am-i-missing-something), but some can be quite enjoyable.

There is also an interesting [article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/544274/Why-I-despise-the-interview-coding-test) that explains why these tests are a waste of time. The concept of doing small coding challenges is a positive one for many reasons, as [Uncle Bob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin) explains in his book [The Clean Coder](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073). However doing these challenges in a live collaboration during an interview is probably not a valid measure of a programmers ability or skill. Perhaps a better use of our time would be contributing to open source projects, then listing some of your best PRs on your linkedin or blog?

Either way, below is a collection of tests I've written in Python;
