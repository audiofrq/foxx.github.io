After seeing the [TechRadar article](http://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/peripherals/build-a-triple-screen-stand-for-25-1090082) on building a cheap strut channel monitor, and an [imgur thread][3] of someone doing this, I decided to have a shot at this myself. The jigsaw made the job much faster, but not before scaring the utter shit out of me. I didn't know you had to put oil on the blades, which meant they not only got blunt extremely fast (30 seconds), they also starting sparking and glowing. I made the mistake of putting the wrong blade in and hit the floor and went flying across the garden. I also pull the jigsaw out of the metal before it stopped moving and the damn thing almost flew out of my hand. 

At one point I realised I made the height bar too high, and my options were to either take it all apart, or balance the entire fucking thing on my desk, and take the jigsaw to it whilst the monitors were attached... I was absolutely bricking it, a jigsaw just inches away from my monitors, whilst being balanced by a friend in mid air to stop it from snapping.

By the end of it, my house was a fucking disaster zone. Metal shards in the carpet, saw dust all up the stairs.. luckily my family helped tidy everything up, so I didn't end up spending my entire Sunday cleaning up mess!! Sadly Fix8, one of the best UK DIY companies, went into administration and other sellers were quite expensive. However we found that [DP Building Systems][4] was very reasonable at £10 for delivery, and they sold both channels and plates. Not all the items are listed on their site, so you may need to call them directly. 

The VESA panels was the hardest part of the entire project. As you can see from the pictures, my wood work skills are awful. Trying to make the holes fit against the monitor is very difficult, and the planks I bought were slightly curved which made it even harder. In total, this project probably cost me around £80 in materials/delivery, took 2 days to make and luckily I was able to borrow most of the necessary equipment from family, and had help from my partner and friend. 

If you are looking for a cheaper alternative for a monitor stand and have some time to kill on shits and giggles, then you should definitely give this a try. Just bear in mind that it requires a lot of patience, trial and error etc... and if you are a DIY noob like me, then you will quickly get frustrated! 

Also remember that these cannot be modified easily after making them, at least not without designing it with this in mind.. you may want to look at monitor arms instead! I'm really happy with the end result, it looks awesome... I don't think I'll ever do it again though :)
