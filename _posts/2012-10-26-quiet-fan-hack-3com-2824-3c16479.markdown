After picking up a used 2824 switch on eBay for only £25, we soon realised the noise was too much for our small office. These switches are "enterprise grade", they have a 24gbit/sec switching fabric (that's full line speed on all ports), and a quiet/desktop version of this sort of product would have easily cost £100+. So, we bought a Rasurbo 40mm x 10mm Quiet Cooling fan replacement for £6 - and got ourselves a bargin at around £40 in total (switch+fan+delivery).


Initially I bought the wrong type of fan (you MUST make sure it is a three-wire, as these fans require speed control to work), and this wasted about £10 on wrong components. Check it :) Also posted on http://imgur.com/a/boCRB

And yes, this will void your warranty ;)
