### Summary

You may already be aware of the legal action by Impero Software against security researcher [Raylee][0], for disclosing a serious vulnerability publicly, even making headlines on [The Register][1] and [The Guardian][2].

In a [letter][3] by their lawyers, they suggested that Raylee's actions were criminal under the UK Computer Misuse Act 1990, and made slanderous claims in a [public PR][4] stating that he has "illegally hacked" their software.

Although it's quite obvious that [Gateley PLC][6], the lawyers in question, have absolutely no understanding of the legal aspects of this situation, it's one that must be taken seriously and fought with action.

Many of us felt compelled to stand up for Raylee, and teach Impero Software a lesson on how to behave on the internet, one which they wouldn't soon forget.

After a brief conversation in [Lizard HQ][7], it was decided the best way to get their attention was to print out a new vulnerability over 9000 times, hand deliver it to their offices, and capture the entire thing on camera for delivery proof, whilst also leaving a copy on every car in their car park.

Suffice to say, this got the attention of their entire office, and other companies in the area.

The official POC disclosure can be found [here][9].

Enjoy.
