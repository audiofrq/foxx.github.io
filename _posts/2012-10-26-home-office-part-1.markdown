Had a couple of people asking what sort of home office set up I have, so here you go (taken in early 2012). I'm a firm believer in spending as little money as possible, and most of the above I either got heavily discounted or second hand from eBay. I'm hoping to make a few improvements in here soon, given that I'm now spending nearly 14 hours a day in here!

* 2x ViewSonic VX2239 monitors 
* 1x Cisco 7940G with SIP firmware 
* Companion cube (made specially by my girl)
* SteelSeries Ikari Mouse 
* Numark NPM5 speakers 
* Large ikea desk

### Cat telling us there's a problem with the New Relic graphs..

### The standard Dell Keyboard started hurting my fingers a bit too much, so ended up taking Harry's lovely Cherry light touch keyboard

### Me and my girl decided there was only one logical choice on what to do with all this packaging... It got messy!!
