### Summary

Today I [discovered](https://twitter.com/sleepycal/status/488831738911940608) an RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability in Browserify `<=4.2.0`, apparently caused by unsafe parsing of `(Function(){})` in Node `<=0.10` used by [node-syntax-error](https://github.com/substack/node-syntax-error).

This was fixed approx 4 hours later by [James Halliday](https://twitter.com/substack) in [#9aa4e66e](https://github.com/substack/node-syntax-error/commit/9aa4e66eb90ec595d2dba55e6f9c2dd9a668b309) and details can be seen [here](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/blob/master/changelog.markdown#421). Upgrade to Browserify `=>4.2.1` to avoid this vuln.

It's also worth noting there are probably several other libraries that are vulnerable to this behavior in Node `<=0.10`, but I haven't got time to check them all.

PS) May I also take this opportunity to say that JS is one of the most horrible languages ever conceived, and Node makes me want to smash my head off a brick wall.
