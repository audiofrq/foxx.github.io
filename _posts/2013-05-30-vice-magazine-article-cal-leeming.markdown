About a year ago, I got talking to [Tom Brewster](https://twitter.com/iblametom), a freelance writer that I met at a dinner on the HMS Belfast hosted by HP. His first question was "so what happened on full-disclosure?", making reference to a spat I had with some of the trolls. He'd clearly done his home work, and left me almost speechless!

After showed a genuine interest in my background, I shared some of the more emotional details about my past  for the first time. Some months later, he released the article on Vice Magazine and it really choked me up to read. 

He represented my background in true Vice style, nothing taken out of context, with all the raw emotion kept intact. Of all the journalists I've met in the last 8 years, he is one of the very few that has earned my respect and trust. Thank you, Tom!

Here is the article, worth reading from start to finish, as it goes into more detail further down;
