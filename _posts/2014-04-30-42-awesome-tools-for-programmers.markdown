Over the years I've tweaked and perfected my workflow to be [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself). Here is a collection of tools that you may not even know exist, and could help improve your workflow. (in no particular order)

### Windows Development

[SandBoxie](http://www.sandboxie.com/) - Sandbox-based isolation that works suprisingly well

[Navicat](http://www.navicat.com/) - Defacto Windows GUI for MySQL management (and others)

[VMWare Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation) - Virtual machine hypervisor, much better than [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) in my opinion.

[KeePass](http://keepass.info/) - Secure password management for those that care about security


### Sublime addons

[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) - Trigger cellular alarms from almost anything

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) - Provides cross integration for hundreds of cloud services

[HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) - Cloud based chat system, but not as good as it once was.

### Things to avoid

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) - This dead rabbit keeps haunting us

[Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) / [Chef](https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home) - Outdated and overly complex bloatware, try [Salt]((http://www.saltstack.com/)) instead.

### Books
